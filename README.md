# CatchBall iOS Game

This is my first game for native iOS development with Swift. 

Basic Features:

- The more you can touch the ball in 30 seconds, the more points you get.
- Your highest score is kept in the device's memory.
- If the game ends within 30 seconds, you will be shown a alert that allows you to play again.
